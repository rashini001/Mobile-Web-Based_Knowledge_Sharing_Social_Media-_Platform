# Mobile + Web Based Knowledge Sharing Social  Media Platform

This repository hosts the source code and documentation for a mobile and web-based knowledge-sharing social media platform designed to improve software engineering education. The platform integrates social networking features with educational tools, enabling students and resource people (mentors, instructors) to collaborate and share knowledge effectively.

# Project Overview
The platform is a modern solution aimed at addressing several challenges in software engineering education, including fragmented learning resources, limited access to industry experts, and administrative inefficiencies. By combining social media functionalities with educational features, the system facilitates seamless interaction, personalized learning, and career guidance.

# Key features include:

User Accounts and Profiles: Individual user accounts with profile management capabilities.
Real-Time Communication: Chat functionality for students and resource people.
Course Management: Create, search, and enroll in courses, with assignments and grading.
Career Path Prediction: Uses machine learning to recommend suitable career paths based on student performance.
Administrative Tools: User management capabilities for administrators to maintain platform integrity.

# Technologies Used

The platform leverages a combination of web and mobile technologies:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flutter (Dart).
Backend: PHP, JavaScript-based AJAX.
Databases: Firebase, MySQL.
Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, PhpStorm, Android Studio.

# Functionalities
